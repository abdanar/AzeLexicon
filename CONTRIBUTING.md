## Contribution Process

Fork the repository to your GitHub account and implement changes in the appropriate files:

**Plain Azerbaijani words** → `data/words.txt`

**Academic or scientific terms** → place in the appropriate subject folder within `data/subjects/` (e.g., `data/subjects/math/`, `data/subjects/physics/`) and update the corresponding `terms.json` file in that folder.

Before submitting a Pull Request (PR), ensure that the **Automated Term Standardization workflow** passes successfully.
