# Contributing to AzeLexicon

We appreciate your interest in contributing to AzeLexicon, a project dedicated to compiling and translating Azerbaijani words. This includes a plain list of Azerbaijani words, hyphenated word forms, and academic or scientific terminology. Contributions may involve adding or correcting words in the main list, improving hyphenated forms, translating academic or scientific terms, or proposing enhancements to structure, formatting, or documentation.

## Contribution Process

🔹**Plain Azerbaijani words** → `data/words.txt`    
🔹**Hyphenated words** → `data/words-hyphenated.txt`   
🔹**Academic or scientific terms** → place in the appropriate subject folder within `data/subjects/` (e.g., `data/subjects/math/`, `data/subjects/physics/`) and update the corresponding `terms.json` file in that folder.   

Commit your changes with a descriptive message, for example:
```bash
