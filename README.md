## Current Status

- Contains Azerbaijani words in `data/azerbaijani.txt`.
- Words are **UTF-8 encoded** and include all special Azerbaijani characters: `ə, ı, ö, ü, ş, ç, ğ`.
- Suitable for **text processing** and as input for **hyphenation pattern creation**.

## Future Plans

The repository will be updated to include:

- **LaTeX hyphenation patterns** for Azerbaijani (Polyglossia/Babel compatible).
- **Automated pattern generation scripts** using TeX Live's `patgen`.
- **Expanded word list** from literature, technical terms, and modern usage.
- **Integration examples** for NLP tasks and spell-checking tools.

## Potential Usage

- **Hyphenation in LaTeX**: Properly format Azerbaijani text using Polyglossia or Babel.
- **NLP Tasks**: Tokenization, spell-checking, text analysis, language modeling.
- **Computational Linguistics Research**: Corpus building, linguistic analysis, education.
- **Software Localization**: Improve Azerbaijani text handling in applications.
